## SRP(Single Responsibility Principle Design Pattern)
1.SRP state that every module,class should have responsibility over a single part of the program's functionality.
Use case:
It helps devs to write code that are decoupled,where each class has its own job and encapsulates responsibilities to other classes.If specification of this job changes,dev makes change to that specific job only.
